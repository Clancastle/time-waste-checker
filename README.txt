EXPECTED OUTPUT:

Alright. So I don't want anything over the top, I might just use the output/terminal,
and expect user input.

Such as:
"{
    variable: 12:00:00 #hrs,
    'gamimg': 4:30:00,
    'coding': 2:49:00, #hour,hour/min,min/sec,sec
    'sleep': 10:01:20,
}"
maybe have this as an entire table (create table day{1})
and automate insertion into table?

or maybe just add it to a current table, and that table has timestamp
# variable is item name
like (variable, time, timestamp)
everyday, a row is added with timestamp for today, if timestamp doesnt exist, its created,
and this would ruin a streak.

ill need pandas?

database> table>
timeproject> data>
idk ill look into this later



# i think ill at first, place it in a dictionary, "{}", and try to take the pairs
and place in a database, then ill try to make it such as

> Date (Today)
> Add Variable: var
> add time: time
or
> add var: time

and user can keep updating until the end of the day.
user cannot update something before today.

i will need timestamps for this i think > most likely

command like /var, to list all variables, so you place a variable/time pair in the correct place.
or /help to list all available commands, list all ways you can see data.

taking a break on the /delete last bug. (race condition stuff i think?)
do smtn else, work on matplot lib or a game.

i think its good pregress so far. but im gonna go learn more more on ai, and ways of saving storing and useing data so i can finish this projet  better.

i might have to make a new table for each day, in a database, and compare tables each day to see if they match.
